Want to using python 3 (on Arch Linux)?

ws4py is easy:
    pacman -S python-ws4py

However, gevent and texttable are tricky
For gevent, official version does not support python 3. @fantix's fork is available.

    sudo pip install -U git+https://github.com/fantix/gevent

For texttable, we need the git version because the latest official release does not support python 3 yet
    sudo pip install -U git+https://github.com/bufordtaylor/python-texttable
